With this <font color=#F5B041>__Jupyter *Notebook*__</font>, you will progressively learn how to just run your first Hello world program, to play with vectors and matrices for linear algebra, to graphically plot results, and to load and save data with external files. Let's start with the well-known Hello World example.\n",

To actually run your code, you just have to type in your terminal the following sentence: `python helloworld.py`. For the *hello world* case, the python file <font color=#F5B041>__helloword.py__</font> is the following one: \n",
    "```Python\n",
    "print(\"Hello World!\")\n",

But since we are using <font color=#F5B041>*__Jupyter Notebook__*</font> we don't need the terminal, instead we have __cells__. So let's try it! In the cell (or box) below this text just type `print(\"Hello World!\")` and click on *play* in the command board at the top of the page."
